You don't need to read the whitepaper to use this notebook, but the papers will give you some theoretical context and background to complement this interactive notebook.\n\n\n## Before you begin\n\nIn this notebook, you'll start exploring prompts and prompt parameters using the Python SDK and AI Studio. For some inspiration, you might enjoy exploring some apps that have been built using the Gemini family of models. Here are a few that we like, and we think you will too.\n\n* [TextFX](https://textfx.withgoogle.com/) is a suite of AI-powered tools for rappers, made in collaboration with Lupe Fiasco,\n* [SQL Talk](https://sql-talk-r5gdynozbq-uc.a.run.app/) shows how you can talk directly to a database using the Gemini API,\n* [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) uses Gemini models to build your own personal AI research assistant.\n\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n\n### A note on the Gemini API and Vertex AI\n\nIn the whitepapers, most of the example code uses the Enterprise [Vertex AI platform](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai). In contrast, this notebook, along with the others in this series, will use the [Gemini Developer API](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/) and [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).\n\nBoth APIs provide access to the Gemini family of models, and the code to interact with the models is very similar. Vertex provides a world-class platform for enterprises, governments and advanced users that need powerful features like data governance, ML ops and deep Google Cloud integration.\n\nAI Studio is free to use and only requires a compatible Google account to log in and get started. It is deeply integrated with the Gemini API, which comes with a generous [free tier](https://ai.google.dev/pricing) that you can use to run the code in these exercises.\n\nIf you are already set up with Google Cloud, you can check out the [Enterprise Gemini API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/model-reference/inference) through Vertex AI, and run the samples directly from the supplied whitepapers.","metadata":{"id":"csNPnkuCobmG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get started with Kaggle notebooks\n\nIf this is your first time using a Kaggle notebook, welcome!

It provides interactive features for data exploration, visualization, and classification model building. Here's a breakdown of its functionalities:\n\n**What it is:**\n\n* **A Streamlit application:**  This file contains Python code designed to create an interactive web application using the Streamlit framework.\n* **Data Analysis Tool:** It focuses on analyzing the breast cancer dataset, providing tools for understanding the data and building classification models.\n\n**Why you would use it:**\n\n* **Data Exploration:**  You could use it to visually inspect the dataset, understand its characteristics, and identify potential patterns or relationships between features. \n* **Visualization:** It allows you to create visualizations like heatmaps and pair plots to better understand the data and its correlations.\n* **Classification Modeling:** The app lets you build and evaluate a Decision Tree classifier, visualizing the tree structure and feature importance to gain insights into how the model makes predictions.\n* **Interactive Learning:** The interactive nature of the app allows you to explore different options, manipulate visualizations, and see the results in real-time, which can aid in understanding the dataset and machine learning concepts.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n* **Data Loading:** It loads the breast cancer dataset from Scikit-learn and creates a Pandas DataFrame for data manipulation.\n* **Tabs for Navigation:** Streamlit's \"selectbox\" is used to provide tabs for easy navigation between data exploration, visualization, and classification model sections.\n* **Data Exploration:**  This section displays statistics about the dataset (e.g., sample size, features) and presents a sample of the data.\n* **Data Visualization:**  The app allows you to create heatmaps to visualize correlations between features and interactive pair plots to explore feature relationships.\n* **Classification Model:** This section builds a Decision Tree classifier, evaluates its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and presents the results in a visually appealing way. It also includes a visualization of the decision tree itself.\n\n**In essence, this file provides a complete and interactive Streamlit application for learning about and analyzing the breast cancer dataset, offering insights into data characteristics, feature interactions, and classification model behavior.** \n"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import subprocess\n# List of URLs for multiple .py files\nfile_urls = [\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lasyaEd/matchCutting/main/shot_segmentation.py\",\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lasyaEd/matchCutting/main/deduplication.py\",\n    \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lasyaEd/matchCutting/main/visualize_scene_cuts.py\"\n]\n\n# Dictionary to store file contents\nfile_contents = {}\n\n# Loop to fetch each file's content\nfor url in file_urls:\n    filename = url.split(\"/\")[-1]  # Extract the file name from the URL\n    result = subprocess.run([\"curl\", url], capture_output=True, text=True)  # Run curl command\n    content = result.stdout  # Get the file content\n    file_contents[filename] = content  # Store content in the dictionary\n\n# Generate explanations for each file\nfor filename, content in file_contents.items():\n    explain_prompt = f\"\"\"\n    Please explain what the file '{filename}' does at a very high level.
